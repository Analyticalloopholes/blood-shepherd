bloodsucker
===========

bloodsucker is my playground of exploration for a sync api to the 
[Dexcom Platinum G4](http://dexcom.com/dexcom-g4-platinum) receiver. 
If you don't know what that is, chances are that it's because you don't have diabetes and it's a good thing.
If you do have diabetes, check it out, the [dexcom](http://dexcom.com/) is a nice tool. 

So, there isn't much to see here at the moment but hopefully, this will be actually sync data from the receiver in the near
future.

This will likely be ported to C/Go when this is done but exploring with Java first.

Quick start
-----------
```mvn clean install```

Run it
------
```java -jar ./target/*jar-with-dependencies.jar```
